# 🏒⚾ Fine-Tuning GPT for Text Classification (Baseball vs Hockey)

This project demonstrates how to **fine-tune a GPT model using the OpenAI API** for a binary text classification task.  
The model is trained to distinguish between **baseball** and **hockey** news articles from the **20 Newsgroups dataset**.

## 🚀 Project Overview
- **Objective**: Train a GPT model to classify sports news into *Baseball* or *Hockey*.  
- **Dataset**: [20 Newsgroups](https://scikit-learn.org/0.19/datasets/twenty_newsgroups.html) (filtered for two categories).  
- **Model**: `gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14` fine-tuned using the **OpenAI API**.  
- **Training**: 8 epochs on ~balanced dataset.  
- **Result**: Achieved **+15% accuracy improvement** compared to the base GPT model.
